**Implementation of Dynamic Time Warping Application for Financial Pattern Recognition** :

For (20XT57) - DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS LAB @PSG COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY

Pattern recognition algorithm for close price patterns using Featured-based Dynamic Time Warping and Pattern Rule

Our pattern searching methodology rests at pattern rule application after Feature-based DTW for warranty of substantial characteristic point relations.

Also, modified NLCS was implemented
